# React Sample Contact List App

## Description
This is a personal React sample project (Contact List) I started working on in my own spare time to illustrate some of my capabilities with React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. One of the main goals of this sample project is to perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations on a friendly responsive user interface.  

In this project I am only using the `create-react-app` built-in features.  As you can see in the source code, everything has been built from scratch. I am not using any library for UI (User Interface), form, validation, etc.     

At its core, I believe this app accomplishes its goal. There's definitely room for improvements and expansion. For now, I'm not planning on expanding it, but I might work on adding unit tests. 

I encourage you to try this React Sample Contact List app on any device including 4K screens, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. If you find a bug or something off on any of your devices, please let me know.
